    "\n",
    "In this guide, we show how one can use the pieces provided by `pylattica` to implement Conway's Game of Life. Conway's Game of Life is a famous cellular automaton defined by mathematician John Conway. It demonstrates the way that very complex phenomena can emerge from simple local interactions, and has been studied extensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Conway's Game of Life, a 2D square grid of cells are labelled as \"alive\" or \"dead\". Then, as the simulation progresses, the cell states flip between \"dead\" and \"alive\" depending on how many living cells surround them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin though, take a quick look at the [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) for the Game of Life to understand what the model is.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, note that the rules describing the game are simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n",
    "2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n",
    "3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n",
    "4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement this model using `pylattica` and show some of the libarary's visualization capabilities."
